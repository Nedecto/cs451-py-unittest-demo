# cs 451 Python unittest Builtin Unit Testing Demo
A simple project to be used to demonstrate and experiment with Python's builtin unit testing framework using the **unittest** package. 

## Instructions

1. Fork this project to your repository.
2. Clone **your fork** to your computer.
3. Complete the development tasks listed below then commit and push your changes back up to your GitHub repo.

## Development Tasks: Using Python unittest module.
This project contains a src directory that contains the definition for a class named *BabySet* (baby_set.py) and a file containing **unittests** for the BabySet class methods (test_babyset.py).

### Step 0:
**Run the tests to see what this testing process looks like.**

```python test_babyset.py```

### Step 1:
The ```baby_set.py``` contains a logic error that will cause 3 unit tests to fail. Fix the error so that all tests **pass**.

**Run the tests.**

```python test_babyset.py```

### Step 2:
```test_baby_set.py``` requires that you implement the unit tests for ```test_remove``` and ```test_clear```. Out of the box, these two unit tests are passing. Read ```baby_set.py``` to understand what you need to test and use the existing unit test implementations as a guide.

### Step 3. 
Commit your changes and push to your remote repository.
